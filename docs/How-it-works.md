# How Does Reloader Work?

Reloader watches for `ConfigMap` and `Secret` and detects if there are changes in data of these objects. After change detection Reloader performs rolling upgrade on relevant Pods via associated `Deployment`, `Daemonset` and `Statefulset`.

## How Does Change Detection Work?

Reloader watches changes in `configmaps` and `secrets` data. As soon as it detects a change in these. It forwards these objects to an update handler which decides if and how to perform the rolling upgrade.

## Requirements for Rolling Upgrade

To perform rolling upgrade a `deployment`, `daemonset` or `statefulset` must have

- support for rolling upgrade strategy
- specific annotation for `configmaps` or `secrets`

The annotation value is comma separated list of `configmaps` or `secrets`. If a change is detected in data of these `configmaps` or `secrets`, Reloader will perform rolling upgrades on their associated `deployments`, `daemonsets` or `statefulsets`.

### Annotation for Configmap

For a `Deployment` called `foo` have a `ConfigMap` called `foo`. Then add this annotation* to your `Deployment`, where the default annotation can be changed with the `--configmap-annotation` flag:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    configmap.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo"
```

### Annotation for Secret

For a `Deployment` called `foo` have a `Secret` called `foo`. Then add this annotation to your `Deployment`, where the default annotation can be changed with the `--secret-annotation` flag:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    secret.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo"
```

Above mentioned annotation are also work for `Daemonsets` `Statefulsets` and `Rollouts`

## How Does Rolling Upgrade Work?

When Reloader detects changes in configmap. It gets two objects of configmap. First object is an old configmap object which has a state before the latest change. Second object is new configmap object which contains latest changes. Reloader compares both objects and see whether any change in data occurred or not. If Reloader finds any change in new configmap object, only then, it moves forward with rolling upgrade.

After that, Reloader gets the list of all `deployments`, `daemonsets` and `statefulset` and looks for above mentioned annotation for configmap. If the annotation value contains the configmap name, it then looks for an environment variable which can contain the configmap or secret data change hash.

### Environment Variable for ConfigMap

If configmap name is foo then

```yaml
STAKATER_FOO_CONFIGMAP
```

### Environment Variable for Secret

If Secret name is foo then

```yaml
STAKATER_FOO_SECRET
```

If the environment variable is found then it gets its value and compares it with new configmap hash value. If old value in environment variable is different from new hash value then Reloader updates the environment variable. If the environment variable does not exist then it creates a new environment variable with latest hash value from configmap and updates the relevant `deployment`, `daemonset` or `statefulset`

Note: Rolling upgrade also works in the same way for secrets.

### Hash Value Computation

Reloader uses SHA1 to compute hash value. SHA1 is used because it is efficient and less prone to collision.

## Monitor All Namespaces

By default Reloader deploys in default namespace and monitors changes in all namespaces. To monitor changes in a specific namespace deploy the Reloader in that namespace and set the `watchGlobally` flag to `false` in values file located under `deployments/kubernetes/chart/reloader` and render manifest file using helm command:

```bash
helm --namespace {replace this with namespace name} template . > reloader.yaml
```

The output file can then be used to deploy Reloader in specific namespace.

## Compatibility With Helm Install and Upgrade

Reloader has no impact on helm deployment cycle. Reloader only injects an environment variable in  `deployment`, `daemonset` or `statefulset`. The environment variable contains the SHA1 value of configmap's or secret's data. So  if a deployment is created using Helm and Reloader updates the deployment, then next time you upgrade the helm release, Reloader will do nothing except changing that environment variable value in `deployment` , `daemonset` or `statefulset`.
