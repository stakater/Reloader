# Reloader vs ConfigmapController

Reloader is inspired from [Configmapcontroller](https://github.com/fabric8io/configmapcontroller) but there are many ways in which it differs from configmapController. Below is the small comparison between these two controllers.

| Reloader                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Configmap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Reloader can watch both `secrets` and `configmaps`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ConfigmapController can only watch changes in `configmaps`. It cannot detect changes in other resources like `secrets`.                                                                                                                                        |
| Reloader can perform rolling upgrades on `deployments` as well as on `statefulsets` and `daemonsets`                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ConfigmapController can only perform rolling upgrades on `deployments`. It currently does not support rolling upgrades on `statefulsets` and `daemonsets`                                                                                                          |
| Reloader provides both unit test cases and end to end integration test cases for future updates. So one can make sure that new changes do not break any old functionality.                                                                                                                                               | Currently there are not any unit test cases or end to end integration test cases in configmap controller. It add difficulties for any additional updates in configmap controller and one can not know for sure whether new changes breaks any old functionality or not. |
| Reloader uses SHA1 to encode the change in configmap or secret. It then saves the SHA1 value in `STAKATER_FOO_CONFIGMAP` or `STAKATER_FOO_SECRET` environment variable depending upon where the change has happened. The use of SHA1 provides a concise 40 characters encoded value that is very less prone to collision. | Configmap controller uses `FABRICB_FOO_REVISION` environment variable to store any change in configmap controller. It does not encode it or convert it in suitable hash value to avoid data pollution in deployment.                                               |
| Reloader allows you to customize your own annotation (for both Secrets and Configmaps) using command line flags | Configmap controller restricts you to only their provided annotation |
