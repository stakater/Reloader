# Reloader vs ConfigmapController

Reloader is inspired from [`configmapcontroller`](https://github.com/fabric8io/configmapcontroller) but there are many ways in which it differs from `configmapcontroller`. Below is the small comparison between these two controllers.

| Reloader                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ConfigMap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Reloader can watch both `Secrets` and `ConfigMaps`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `configmapcontroller` can only watch changes in `ConfigMaps`. It cannot detect changes in other resources like `Secrets`.                                                                                                                                        |
| Reloader can perform rolling upgrades on `deployments` as well as on `statefulsets` and `daemonsets`                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `configmapcontroller` can only perform rolling upgrades on `deployments`. It currently does not support rolling upgrades on `statefulsets` and `daemonsets`                                                                                                          |
| Reloader provides both unit test cases and end to end integration test cases for future updates. So one can make sure that new changes do not break any old functionality.                                                                                                                                               | Currently there are not any unit test cases or end to end integration test cases in `configmap-controller`. It add difficulties for any additional updates in `configmap-controller` and one can not know for sure whether new changes breaks any old functionality or not. |
| Reloader uses SHA1 to encode the change in `ConfigMap` or `Secret`. It then saves the SHA1 value in `STAKATER_FOO_CONFIGMAP` or `STAKATER_FOO_SECRET` environment variable depending upon where the change has happened. The use of SHA1 provides a concise 40 characters encoded value that is very less prone to collision. |  `configmap-controller` uses `FABRICB_FOO_REVISION` environment variable to store any change in `ConfigMap` controller. It does not encode it or convert it in suitable hash value to avoid data pollution in deployment.                                               |
| Reloader allows you to customize your own annotation (for both `Secrets` and `ConfigMaps`) using command line flags | `configmap-controller` restricts you to only their provided annotation |
