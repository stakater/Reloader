# Reloader vs ConfigmapController

Reloader is inspired from [configmapcontroller](https://github.com/fabric8io/configmapcontroller) but there are many ways in which it differs from configmapController. Below is the small comparison between these two controllers.

| Configmap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Reloader                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| ConfigmapController can only watch changes in `configmaps`. It cannot detect changes in other resources like `secrets`.                                                                                                                                        | Reloader on the other hand can watch and detect changes in both `secrets` and `configmaps`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ConfigmapController can only perform rolling upgrades on `deployments`. It currently does not support rolling upgrades on `statefulsets` and `daemonsets`                                                                                                          | Reloader on the other hand can perform rolling upgrades on `deployments` as well as on `statefulsets` and `daemonsets`                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Currently there are no unit test cases or end to end integration test cases in configmap controller. It add difficulties for any additional updates in configmap controller and one can not know for sure if new changes break any older functionality or not. | Reloader provides both unit test cases and end to end integration test cases for future updates. So one can make sure that new changes do not break any older functionality.                                                                                                                                               |
| Configmap controller uses `FABRICB_FOO_REVISION` environment variable to store any change in configmap controller. It does not encode it or convert it in suitable hash value to avoid data pollution in deployment.                                               | Reloader uses SHA1 to encode the change in configmap or secret. It then saves the SHA1 value in `STAKATER_FOO_CONFIGMAP` or `STAKATER_FOO_SECRET` environment variable depending upon where the change has happened. The use of SHA1 provides a concise 40 characters encoded value that is also very less pron to collision. |
