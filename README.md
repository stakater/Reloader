# RELOADER

## Problem

We would like to watch if some change happens in `ConfigMap` and `Secret` objects and then perform rolling upgrade on relevant `Deployment`, `Deamonset` and `Statefulset`

## Solution

Reloader can watch changes in `ConfigMap` and `Secret` and do rolling upgrades on Pods with their associated `Deployments`, `Deamonsets` and `Statefulsets`.

**NOTE:** This controller has been inspired from [configmapController](https://github.com/fabric8io/configmapcontroller)

## How to use Reloader

For a `Deployment` called `foo` have a `ConfigMap` called `foo`. Then add this annotation to your `Deployment`

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    configmap.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo"
```

OR

For a `Deployment` called `foo` have a `Secret` called `foo`. Then add this annotation to your `Deployment`

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    secret.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo"
```

## Deploying to Kubernetes

You can deploy Reloader by following methods:

### Vanilla Manifests

You can apply vanilla manifests by running the following command

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/Reloader/master/deployments/kubernetes/reloader.yaml
```

### Helm Charts

Alternatively if you have configured helm on your cluster, you can add reloader to helm from our public chart repository and deploy it via helm using below mentioned commands

 ```bash
helm repo add stakater https://stakater.github.io/stakater-charts

helm repo update

helm install stakater/reloader
```

## Monitor All namespaces

By default Reloader gets deployed in `default` namespace and watches changes `secrets` and `configmaps` in all namespaces.
