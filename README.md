# RELOADER

## Problem

We would like to watch if some change happens in `ConfigMap` and `Secret` objects and then perform certain upgrade on relevant `Deployment`, `Deamonset` and `Statefulset`

## Solution

Reloader can watch any changes in `ConfigMap` and `Secret` objects and update or recreate Pods for their associated `Deployments`, `Deamonsets` and `Statefulsets`. In this way Pods can get the latest changes in `ConfigMap` or `Secret` objects.

**NOTE:** This controller has been inspired from [configmapController](https://github.com/fabric8io/configmapcontroller)

## How to use Reloader

For a `Deployment` called `foo` have a `ConfigMap` called `foo`. Then add this annotation to your `Deployment`

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    configmap.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo"
```

OR

For a `Deployment` called `foo` have a `Secret` called `foo`. Then add this annotation to your `Deployment`

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    secret.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo"
```

Then, providing `Reloader` is running, whenever you edit the `ConfigMap` or `Secret` called `foo` the Reloader will update the `Deployment` by adding the environment variable:

```
STAKATER_FOO_REVISION=${reloaderRevision}
```

This then triggers a rolling upgrade of your deployment's pods to use the new configuration.

Same procedure can be followed to perform rolling upgrade on `Deamonsets` and `Statefulsets` as well.

## Deploying to Kubernetes

You can deploy Reloader by running the following kubectl commands:

```bash
kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml -n <namespace>
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n <namespace>
```

### Vanilla Manifests

You can apply vanilla manifests by running the following command

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/Reloader/master/deployments/kubernetes/reloader.yaml
```

### Helm Charts

Or alternatively if you configured `helm` on your cluster, you can deploy Reloader via helm chart located under `deployments/kubernetes/chart/reloader` folder.

### Monitor All namespaces
You can monitor all namespaces in cluster by setting the `watchGlobally` flag to `true` in manifest file.
